## New in 6.1.1

**Notifications on Windows and Linux.** The end of a run is reported through
the system on all three platforms now: on Windows a click on the toast opens
the interface, Linux uses `notify-send` where present. macOS is unchanged.

**A sturdier mirror walk.** The enumeration of a large library saves its
progress as it goes: an interrupted run resumes where it stopped instead of
starting over, and when only downloads were left, the next run skips the
enumeration entirely. The walk also needs a fraction of the memory it did.

**Smaller things.** The log panel can be dragged taller and remembers its
size, page content ends above it instead of disappearing behind it, and the
app icon now sits next to the title.

## Which file?

| File | For |
|---|---|
| `Munimentum-macos-arm64.dmg` | Mac with Apple Silicon (M1 or newer) |
| `Munimentum-windows-x64.zip` | Windows 10/11 (64-bit) |
| `Munimentum-linux-x64.tar.gz` | Linux (64-bit, glibc 2.35+) |


## Getting started

**macOS** — double-click the DMG, drag `Munimentum.app` onto the
*Applications* folder shown next to it, close (eject) the window, and start the
app from *Applications*.

**Windows** — unpack the ZIP (right-click → *Extract All*, not just looking
inside), then double-click `Munimentum.exe` in the extracted folder.

**Linux** — `tar -xzf Munimentum-linux-x64.tar.gz`, then run
`./Munimentum/Munimentum`.

The interface then opens by itself in your default browser. Everything else —
fetching a token, exporting, searching — is explained there.

## “Windows protected your PC”

**macOS is signed and notarized by Apple** — it opens on a double-click, with
no warning and nothing to click past.

**Windows is not code-signed.** A certificate costs considerably more there, and
SmartScreen additionally wants to see a download count before it goes quiet. So
on first launch you get the blue window: click *“More info”*, then *“Run
anyway”*. It happens once.

If you would rather not, run it from source instead (`python3 app.py`, see the
README) — the function and the result are identical.

## Optional: Ollama

Without Ollama everything works except *meaning-based* search — export,
full-text search and the MCP server for Claude run normally. The app asks at
startup and explains the installation if you want it.

With Ollama, *Search data* gains two more kinds of search: *Similar search* and
*AI summary*. Both run on your machine; nothing leaves it. See the README.

## Checksums

`SHA256SUMS.txt` is attached. Verify with `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt`
(macOS/Linux) or `Get-FileHash file.zip` (PowerShell).

What comes next is in `ROADMAP.md`.
