## New in 13.8.1

More speed, and one fix the faster runs brought to light.

- **Changed items reach the search** – a rescheduled appointment or a
  mail deleted at Microsoft now updates the search and the calendar even
  when the run brought nothing new.
- **Mail** – the folders are checked one bundle after another, which
  keeps Microsoft from making the run wait. The log names only folders
  with changes, plus one line for all.
- **SharePoint, Planner, index** – several URLs into one site ask for it
  once, Planner comments come in bundles, and the files next to Teams
  chats are no longer read again on every index run.

## Upgrading

Nothing to do after this update.

Skipping releases is fine: whatever an older release does once after an
update, the first run does too. What changes for scripts against the
HTTP interface is in the notes of the release that changed it – see
[all releases](https://github.com/n-schilling/munimentum/releases).
Coming from far back? A quick look through the notes you skipped shows
whether any of them asks something of you.

## Which file?

| File | For |
|---|---|
| `Munimentum-macos-arm64.dmg` | Mac with Apple Silicon (M1 or newer) |
| `Munimentum-windows-x64.zip` | Windows 10/11 (64-bit) |
| `Munimentum-linux-x64.tar.gz` | Linux (64-bit, glibc 2.35+) |


## Getting started

**macOS** — double-click the DMG, drag `Munimentum.app` onto the
*Applications* folder shown next to it, close (eject) the window, and start the
app from *Applications*.

**Windows** — unpack the ZIP (right-click → *Extract All*, not just looking
inside), then double-click `Munimentum.exe` in the extracted folder.

**Linux** — `tar -xzf Munimentum-linux-x64.tar.gz`, then run
`./Munimentum/Munimentum`.

The interface then opens by itself in your default browser. Everything else —
fetching a token, exporting, searching — is explained there.

## “Windows protected your PC”

**macOS is signed and notarized by Apple** — it opens on a double-click, with
no warning and nothing to click past.

**Windows is not code-signed.** A certificate costs considerably more there, and
SmartScreen additionally wants to see a download count before it goes quiet. So
on first launch you get the blue window: click *“More info”*, then *“Run
anyway”*. It happens once.

If you would rather not, run it from source instead (`python3 app.py`, see the
README) — the function and the result are identical.

## Checksums

`SHA256SUMS.txt` is attached. Verify with `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt`
(macOS/Linux) or `Get-FileHash file.zip` (PowerShell).

What comes next is in `ROADMAP.md`.
